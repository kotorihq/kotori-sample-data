bio: |
  Minori is a girl in Ryuuji's class, and is a close friend to Taiga. She is also known by the pet name "Minorin". 
  In contrast to the negative Taiga, Minori is always smiling and cheerful, but is also a natural airhead, 
  though it is suggested that her airhead ways may be a facade. She is very athletic and is the captain of the girl's softball club at school,
  though at the same time she holds many part time jobs. She is a glutton when it comes to food, but is also constantly combating with dieting.
